# Valkyrie-1 Flight Performance Estimator

This is a Python tool to simulate the **Thrust vs Drag**, **Power Required for Level Flight**, and **Effect of Mach Number and Altitude** on the performance of the Valkyrie-1 UAV. 

## Features

- **Thrust vs Drag**: Calculates the thrust and drag at various altitudes and speeds.
- **Power for Level Flight**: Simulates the power required for level flight.
- **Mach Number and Altitude**: Visualizes how Mach number and altitude affect the UAV performance.
- **Input Options**: Choose between **CLI** or **GUI** for input (currently CLI is the default).
- **Matplotlib Animation**: Includes a dynamic plot animation of Thrust vs Drag.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` for plotting and animation
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
- `tkinter` for GUI-based input (optional)

## Installation
